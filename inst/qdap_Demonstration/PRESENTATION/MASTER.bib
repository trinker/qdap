	Individual Child Engagement Record (ICER), an instrument designed
	to observe and measure the engagement of children with disabilities
	in early childhood settings.(1) METHOD: The ICER was revised with
	reference to pilot study results and the literature. Inter-observer
	reliability of the revised measure (ICER-R) was examined by calculating
	levels of agreement between observers coding video-clips of children
	with disabilities engaged in three different activity types (mealtime,
	free play, and structured group time) in an inclusive childcare centre.
	The E-Qual III was used as a criterion measure to examine concurrent
	validity. RESULTS: Good overall percentage agreement and kappa coefficients
	were achieved for the codes recorded. A statistically significant
	correlation was found between data gathered using the ICER-R and
	the E-Qual III when comparing total engaged behaviours. CONCLUSIONS:
	The ICER-R was found to be a vali},
