Description: Automates many of the tasks associated with quantitative discourse analysis of
          transcripts containing discourse including frequency counts of sentence types,
          words, sentences, turns of talk, syllables and other assorted analysis tasks. The
          package provides parsing tools for preparing transcript data. Many functions enable
          the user to aggregate data by any number of grouping variables, providing analysis
          and seamless integration with other R packages that undertake higher level analysis
          and visualization of text. This affords the user a more efficient and targeted
          analysis. 'qdap' is designed for transcript analysis, however, many functions are
          applicable to other areas of Text Mining/ Natural Language Processing.
