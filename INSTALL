Mac Users
=========
Mac users must install openNLP from source before attempting to install qdap.

This may require installing the appropriate version XTools from the Apple Developer site (https://developer.apple.com/xcode/). You may need to register as an Apple developer (https://developer.apple.com/programs/register/). An older version of XTools may also be required.

    install.packages("openNLP", type = "source")
    install.packages("qdap", type = "source")



Windows Users
=============
Windows users may need to install RCurl before installing qdap. Use the following short script:

    URL <- "http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/RWin/bin/windows/contrib/3.0/"
    install.packages("RCurl", contriburl = URL)
    install.packages("qdap")

Additionally, if there is a discrepency between the R and Java architectures (https://dl.dropbox.com/u/61803503/rjava_warning.txt) you will have to download the appropriate version of Java compatable with the version of R you're using (http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp).
